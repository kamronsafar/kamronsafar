**Kamron Saparbayev** 

My full name is **Saparbayev Kamron**, and I am interested in **Software Engineering**.
When it comes to other fields, I am also interested in **Cyber Security**.
It’s true that there may be few projects I’ve uploaded to GitHub, but that doesn’t mean I lack interest.

I’m most active and highly productive when I **start new projects** or **work in a team** — that’s when my capabilities reach their **peak level**.
I always try to handle **big tasks** on my own because I find them both **interesting and effective**.
